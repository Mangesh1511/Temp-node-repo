File System Modules(fs): 
There are two types of the fs modules 
Syncronous and aschyncronous module

Synchronous Module:
    In this module we can say that if any user performs the operation then the other user cannot perform 
    that operation is completed and all  other operations related to it are completed.
    Executes the code line by line
    It is time consuming

Asyncronous Module:
     In this module nested call backs are present.
     Here in this module if one of the task given by any user is completed then other can execute the task 
     without completing the tasks of the other users.
     It is better to serve the more number of users and it is time efficient.
     It does not executes the code line by line.


HTTP Module:
Using create Server the server is local hosted and res,req are the two important parameters of 
HTTP module req.url will take us to the requested url if present 
Here One of the local port is used to serve here it is 5000
